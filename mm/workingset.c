/*
 *		Double CLOCK lists
 *
 * Per node, two clock lists are maintained for file pages: the
 * inactive and the active list.  Freshly faulted pages start out at
 * the head of the inactive list and page reclaim scans pages from the
 * tail.  Pages that are accessed multiple times on the inactive list
 * are promoted to the active list, to protect them from reclaim,
 * whereas active pages are demoted to the inactive list when the
 * active list grows too big.
 *
 *   fault ------------------------+
 *                                 |
 *              +--------------+   |            +-------------+
 *   reclaim <- |   inactive   | <-+-- demotion |    active   | <--+
 *              +--------------+                +-------------+    |
 *                     |                                           |
 *                     +-------------- promotion ------------------+
 *
 *
 *		Access frequency and refault distance
 *
 * A workload is thrashing when its pages are frequently used but they
 * are evicted from the inactive list every time before another access
 * would have promoted them to the active list.
 *
 * In cases where the average access distance between thrashing pages
 * is bigger than the size of memory there is nothing that can be
 * done - the thrashing set could never fit into memory under any
 * circumstance.
 *
 * However, the average access distance could be bigger than the
 * inactive list, yet smaller than the size of memory.  In this case,
 * the set could fit into memory if it weren't for the currently
 * active pages - which may be used more, hopefully less frequently:
 *
 *      +-memory available to cache-+
 *      |                           |
 *      +-inactive------+-active----+
 *  a b | c d e f g h i | J K L M N |
 *      +---------------+-----------+
 *
 * It is prohibitively expensive to accurately track access frequency
 * of pages.  But a reasonable approximation can be made to measure
 * thrashing on the inactive list, after which refaulting pages can be
 * activated optimistically to compete with the existing active pages.
 *
 * For such approximation, we introduce a counter `eviction` (E)
 * here. This counter increases each time a page is evicted, and each evicted
 * page will have a shadow that stores the counter reading at the eviction
 * time as a timestamp. So when an evicted page was faulted again, we have:
 *
 *   Let SP = ((E's reading @ current) - (E's reading @ eviction))
 *
 *                            +-memory available to cache-+
 *                            |                           |
 *  +-------------------------+===============+===========+
 *  | *   shadows  O O  O     |   INACTIVE    |   ACTIVE  |
 *  +-+-----------------------+===============+===========+
 *    |                       |
 *    +-----------------------+
 *    |         SP
 *  fault page          O -> Hole left by previously faulted in pages
 *                      * -> The page corresponding to SP
 *
 * Here SP can stands for how far the current workflow could push a page
 * out of available memory. Since all evicted page was once head of
 * INACTIVE list, the page could have such an access distance of:
 *
 *   SP + NR_INACTIVE
 *
 * So if:
 *
 *   SP + NR_INACTIVE < NR_INACTIVE + NR_ACTIVE
 *
 * Which can be simplified to:
 *
 *   SP < NR_ACTIVE
 *
 * Then the page is worth getting re-activated to start from ACTIVE part,
 * since the access distance is shorter than total memory to make it stay.
 *
 * And since this is only an estimation, based on several hypotheses, and
 * it could break the ability of LRU to distinguish a workingset out of
 * caches, so throttle this by two factors:
 *
 * 1. Notice that re-faulted in pages may leave "holes" on the shadow
 *    part of LRU, that part is left unhandled on purpose to decrease
 *    re-activate rate for pages that have a large SP value (the larger
 *    SP value a page have, the more likely it will be affected by such
 *    holes).
 * 2. When the ACTIVE part of LRU is long enough, challenging ACTIVE pages
 *    by re-activating a one-time faulted previously INACTIVE page may not
 *    be a good idea, so throttle the re-activation when ACTIVE > INACTIVE
 *    by comparing with INACTIVE instead.
 *
 * Combined all above, we have:
 * Upon refault, if any of the following conditions is met, mark the page
 * as active:
 *
 * - If ACTIVE LRU is low (NR_ACTIVE < NR_INACTIVE), check if:
 *   SP < NR_ACTIVE
 *
 * - If ACTIVE LRU is high (NR_ACTIVE >= NR_INACTIVE), check if:
 *   SP < NR_INACTIVE
 *
 *		Refaulting inactive pages
 *
 * All that is known about the active list is that the pages have been
 * accessed more than once in the past.  This means that at any given
 * time there is actually a good chance that pages on the active list
 * are no longer in active use.
 *
 * So when a refault distance of (R - E) is observed and there are at
 * least (R - E) pages in the userspace workingset, the refaulting page
 * is activated optimistically in the hope that (R - E) pages are actually
 * used less frequently than the refaulting page - or even not used at
 * all anymore.
 *
 * That means if inactive cache is refaulting with a suitable refault
 * distance, we assume the cache workingset is transitioning and put
 * pressure on the current workingset.
 *
 * If this is wrong and demotion kicks in, the pages which are truly
 * used more frequently will be reactivated while the less frequently
 * used once will be evicted from memory.
 *
 * But if this is right, the stale pages will be pushed out of memory
 * and the used pages get to stay in cache.
 *
 *		Refaulting active pages
 *
 * If on the other hand the refaulting pages have recently been
 * deactivated, it means that the active list is no longer protecting
 * actively used cache from reclaim. The cache is NOT transitioning to
 * a different workingset; the existing workingset is thrashing in the
 * space allocated to the page cache.
 *
 *
 *		Implementation
 *
 * For each node's LRU lists, a counter for inactive evictions and
 * activations is maintained (node->evictions).
 *
 * On eviction, a snapshot of this counter (along with some bits to
 * identify the node) is stored in the now empty page cache
 * slot of the evicted page.  This is called a shadow entry.
 *
 * On cache misses for which there are shadow entries, an eligible
 * refault distance will immediately activate the refaulting page.
